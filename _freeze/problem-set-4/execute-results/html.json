You will be required to work with a 'raw' dataset, downloaded from an online repository. For this reason, you should take care to check how the data is coded. \n\nYou will be using a version of the US Current Population Survey (CPS) called the [Merged Outgoing Rotation Group](https://www.nber.org/research/data/current-population-survey-cps-merged-outgoing-rotation-group-earnings-data) (MORG). This data is compiled by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and has been used in many famous studies of the US economy. The CPS has a rather unique rotating panel design: \"The monthly CPS is a rotating panel design; households are interviewed for four consecutive months, are not in the sample for the next eight months, and then are interviewed for four more consecutive months.\" ([source: IPUMS](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/sample_designs.shtml)). The NBER's MORG keeps only the outgoing rotation group's observations.\n\nThe MORG .dta files can be found at: <https://data.nber.org/morg/annual/>.\n\n## Preamble\n\nCreate a do-file for this problem set and include a preamble that sets the directory and opens the data **directly from the NBER website**. Of course, this requires a good internet connection. For example, \n\n\n::: {#102deb90 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\nclear \n//or, to remove all stored values (including macros, matrices, scalars, etc.) \n*clear all\n\n* Replace $rootdir with the relevant path to on your local harddrive.\ncd \"$rootdir/problem-sets/ps-4\"\n\ncap log close\nlog using problem-set-4-log.txt, replace\n\nuse \"https://data.nber.org/morg/annual/morg19.dta\", clear\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can, of course, download the data and open it locally on your computer. \n\n## Questions\n\n**1.** Create a new variable `exper` equal to age minus (years of education + 6). This is referred to as potential years of experience. Check how each variable defines missing values before proceeding. You will need to create a years of education variable for this. Here is he the suggested code:\n\n::: {#b27e31bf .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\ntab grade92, m\ngen eduyrs = .\n\treplace eduyrs = .3 if grade92==31\n\treplace eduyrs = 3.2 if grade92==32\n\treplace eduyrs = 7.2 if grade92==33\n\treplace eduyrs = 7.2 if grade92==34\n\treplace eduyrs = 9  if grade92==35\n\treplace eduyrs = 10 if grade92==36\n\treplace eduyrs = 11 if grade92==37\n\treplace eduyrs = 12 if grade92==38\n\treplace eduyrs = 12 if grade92==39\n\treplace eduyrs = 13 if grade92==40\n\treplace eduyrs = 14 if grade92==41\n\treplace eduyrs = 14 if grade92==42\n\treplace eduyrs = 16 if grade92==43\n\treplace eduyrs = 18 if grade92==44\n\treplace eduyrs = 18 if grade92==45\n\treplace eduyrs = 18 if grade92==46\n\tlab var eduyrs \"completed education\"\ntab grade92, sum(eduyrs)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**2.** Keep only those between the ages of 18 and 54. Check the distribution of `exper' and replace any negative values to 0.\n\n\n**3.** Create a categorical variable that takes on 4 values: 1 \"less than High School\"; 2 \"High School Diploma\"; 3 \"some Higher Education\"; 4 \"Bachelors\"; 5 \"Postgraduate\". This variable should be based on the the `grade92` variable. You can find the value labels for this variable in this document: <https://data.nber.org/morg/docs/cpsx.pdf>. I suggest using the `recode` command, which allows you to create value labels while assigning values. Check the distributio of `exper` by education category. \n\n\n**4.** Create the variable `lnwage` equal to the (natural) log of weekly earnings. Create a figure that shows the predicted *linear* fit of `lwage` against `exper`, by `educat`. Try to place all 5 fitted lines in the same graph. \n\n\n**5.** Estimate a linear regression model that allows the slope coefficient on `exper` and constant term to vary by education category (`educat`). Let the base (excluded) education category be 2 \"High School diploma\". \n\n$$\n  \\ln(Wage_i) = \\alpha + \\sum_{j\\neq2}\\psi_j \\mathbf{1}\\{Educat_i=j\\} + \\beta Exper_i + \\sum_{j\\neq2}\\gamma_j Exper_i\\times\\mathbf{1}\\{Educat_i=j\\}+\\upsilon_i\n$$\n\n\n**6.** Show that after 13 years of experience, those with some Higer Education (but no Bachelors), out earn those with just a high school diploma. You can assume that there are is a 2 year difference between the experience (education). \n\n\n**7.** Use the post-estimation `test` command to test the null hypothesis: $H_0: 15\\beta = 13(\\beta+\\gamma_3)+\\psi_3$.\n\n**8.** Estimate a transformed version of the above model allowing you to test the above hypothesis using the coefficient from a single regressor. That is, the resulting test should be a simple t-test of $H_0: \\phi=0$, where $\\phi$ is the coefficient on the interaction of `exper` and a dummy variable for `educat`=3. This will be easier to do if you estimate the model using only the relevant sample: those with High School diplomas and some Higher Education. I suggest avoiding the use of factor notation to create the dummy variables and interaction terms for this exercise. For example, the following should replicate the relevant coefficients from Q5.\n\n::: {#7ba09870 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\ngen hasHE = educat==3 if inlist(educat,2,3)\ngen hasHEexp = hasHE*exper\n\nreg lnwage exper hasHE hasHEexp\n```\n:::\n\n\n**9.** Verify that the F-statistic from Q7 is the square of the above T-statistic. \n\n\n**10.** Use the restricted OLS approach to replicate the F-statistic and p-value from Q7. \n\n\n**11.** Use the restricted OLS approach to test the following hypothesis corresponding to the model in Q5:\n\n$$\nH_0: \\gamma_j = 0\\qquad \\text{for}\\quad j=1,3,4,5\n$$\nCompute the F-statistic and p-value. Verify your result using the post-estimation `test` command. \n\n\n**12.** Compute the relevant Chi-squared distributed test statistic and corresponding p-value for the above test, assuming $n$ is large (enough). \n\n\n**13.** Using the data from Problem Set 2, estimate the simple linear regression model using OLS, \n\n$$\n  \\ln(Wage_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Educ_i + \\beta_2 Female_i + \\varepsilon_i\n$$\n\n\n**14.** Estimate the model using Maximum Likelihood. Take a look at <https://www.stata.com/manuals13/rmlexp.pdf>, the documentation for the `mlexp` command. It has a discussion on estimating the CLRM using ML.[^1]\n\n[^1]: You can also look at the following resource for a more flexible approach to ML estimation in Stata: <https://www.stata.com/features/overview/maximum-likelihood-estimation/>\n\n\n**15.** Estimate the model using Method of Moments. You can use the `gmm` command in Stata. Hint: the regressors will be their own instruments and use the `onestep` option.[^2]\n\n[^2]: Here is a resource on GMM in Stata: <https://www.stata.com/features/overview/generalized-method-of-moments/>\n\n## Postamble\n\n::: {#c4f0bd54 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\nlog close\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
