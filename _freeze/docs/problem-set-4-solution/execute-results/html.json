You will be required to work with a 'raw' dataset, downloaded from an online repository. For this reason, you should take care to check how the data is coded. \n\nYou will be using a version of the US Current Population Survey (CPS) called the ![Merged Outgoing Rotation Group](https://www.nber.org/research/data/current-population-survey-cps-data-nber#:~:text=Merged%20Outgoing%20Rotation%20Groups%20(MORG,weekly%20hours%2Fearnings%20are%20asked.) (MORG). This data is compiled by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and has been used in many famous studies of the US economy. The CPS has a rather unique rotating panel design: \"The monthly CPS is a rotating panel design; households are interviewed for four consecutive months, are not in the sample for the next eight months, and then are interviewed for four more consecutive months.\" (![source](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/sample_designs.shtml)). The NBER's MORG keeps only the outgoing rotation group's observations.\n\nThe MORG .dta files can be found at ![https://data.nber.org/morg/annual/](https://data.nber.org/morg/annual/).\n\n## Preamble\n\n\n::: {#25f0cff2 .cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<style>div.jp-Notebook .datagrid-container {min-height: 448px; }</style>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCreate a do-file for this problem set and include a preamble that sets the directory and opens the data **directly from the NBER website**. Of course, this requires a good internet connection. For example, \n\n::: {#81859069 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\nclear \n//or, to remove all stored values (including macros, matrices, scalars, etc.) \n*clear all\n\n* Replace $rootdir with the relevant path to on your local harddrive.\ncd \"$rootdir/problem-sets/ps-4\"\n\ncap log close\nlog using problem-set-4.txt, replace\n\nuse \"https://data.nber.org/morg/annual/morg19.dta\", clear\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
