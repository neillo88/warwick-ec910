# Econometrics B {background-color="rgba(109,205,184,.7)"}

EC910/EC987

## Outline

The general structure of EC910 (or EC987[^1]); including,

[^1]: MSc BES Economics-track students only take term 1 of Econometrics B

-   who it's for;

-   'metrics A or B;

-   a tentative syllabus.

## Who's it for?

Target audience: [someone who wants to understand the language and concepts needed to comprehend more technical Economic research.]{style="color: rgba(60,16,83,1);"}

Because,

::: incremental
1.  you are *considering* a PhD;

2.  you have a strong background in Econometrics, Statistics, or Mathematics (incl., Physics and Engineering);

3.  your favourite question is "Why?" and proofs help you sleep;

4.  you don't like sunshine and prefer Greek letters.
:::

## Litmus Test

What is the first thing you think, when you see this?

. . .

$$
\bigg[\underbrace{n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial g(W_i,\hat{\theta}^{GMM})}{\partial \theta'}}_{Q_n\big(\hat{\theta}^{GMM}\big)}\bigg]'A_n'A_n n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}g(W_i,\hat{\theta}^{GMM}) = 0
$$

. . .

-   "please, NO MORE"

-   "interesting, tell me more"

## Individual Learning Outcomes

By the end of this year, you should be able to:

::: incremental
1.  discuss and prove the properties of common estimators, and demonstrate these properties using simulations;

2.  compute various estimators using experimental and observational data;

3.  use statistical languages/software (R/Stata);

4.  accurately interpret and discuss the results of empirical research output;

5.  engage more confidently with technical Economics research.

## Metrics A or B

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Metrics B:

1.  assumes familiarity with basic material

2.  more methodological, incl. proofs

3.  theory focused

4.  use vector notation

5.  applications in seminars

## Foundation

Metrics B assumes you have a good knowledge of the following:

1.  t and F tests for linear restrictions
2.  Heteroskedasticity and Serial Correlation
3.  Estimation - in the presence of above problems
4.  Dummy variables.
5.  Exogeneity and Endogeneity
